/* =============================================================================
 * Transactional Memory System Interface
 *
 * TM_ARG
 * TM_ARG_ALONE
 * TM_ARGDECL
 * TM_ARGDECL_ALONE
 *     Used to pass TM thread meta data to functions (see Examples below)
 *
 * TM_STARTUP(numThread)
 *     Startup the TM system (call before any other TM calls)
 *
 * TM_SHUTDOWN()
 *     Shutdown the TM system
 *
 * TM_THREAD_ENTER()
 *     Call when thread first enters parallel region
 *
 * TM_THREAD_EXIT()
 *     Call when thread exits last parallel region
 *
 * P_MALLOC(size)
 *     Allocate memory inside parallel region
 *
 * P_FREE(ptr)
 *     Deallocate memory inside parallel region
 *
 * TM_MALLOC(size)
 *     Allocate memory inside atomic block / transaction
 *
 * TM_FREE(ptr)
 *     Deallocate memory inside atomic block / transaction
 *
 * TM_BEGIN()
 *     Begin atomic block / transaction
 *
 * TM_BEGIN_RO()
 *     Begin atomic block / transaction that only reads shared data
 *
 * TM_END()
 *     End atomic block / transaction
 *
 * TM_RESTART()
 *     Restart atomic block / transaction
 *
 * TM_EARLY_RELEASE()
 *     Remove speculatively read line from the read set
 *
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *
 *     MAIN(argc,argv)
 *     {
 *         TM_STARTUP(8);
 *         // create 8 threads and go parallel
 *         TM_SHUTDOWN();
 *     }
 *
 *     void parallel_region ()
 *     {
 *         TM_THREAD_ENTER();
 *         subfunction1(TM_ARG_ALONE);
 *         subfunction2(TM_ARG  1, 2, 3);
 *         TM_THREAD_EXIT();
 *     }
 *
 *     void subfunction1 (TM_ARGDECL_ALONE)
 *     {
 *         TM_BEGIN_RO()
 *         // ... do work that only reads shared data ...
 *         TM_END()
 *
 *         long* array = (long*)P_MALLOC(10 * sizeof(long));
 *         // ... do work ...
 *         P_FREE(array);
 *     }
 *
 *     void subfunction2 (TM_ARGDECL  long a, long b, long c)
 *     {
 *         TM_BEGIN();
 *         long* array = (long*)TM_MALLOC(a * b * c * sizeof(long));
 *         // ... do work that may read or write shared data ...
 *         TM_FREE(array);
 *         TM_END();
 *     }
